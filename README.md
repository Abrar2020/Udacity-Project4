# Udacity-Project4- Predicting Suicide rates in Countres used Extreme Gradient boosting Regression 
This project introduces the background and theories used to build the model for predicting suicide rates. Also, the reasons behind model selection, theories this project will follow to solve the problem, and evaluation methods. outlines the overall methodology using CRISP-DM stand for cross-industry process for data mining 

 
 
 
 
 
Domain understanding: suicide problem, suicide factors, the importance of machine learning in solving the research problem. 
Data Understanding: appropriate intensive methods to understand the data and prepare data for modeling. 
Data Preparing: Missing data imputation, remove outliers and redundant variables, data transformation, feature extraction. 
Modeling : XGBR 
Evaluation: MAE, RMSE.
